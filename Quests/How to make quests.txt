To make a quest you have to name it according to the last quests number.
Each quest is made of 3 files ending with {name}(_obj/_code/_ans).txt
		EXAMPLE:
		 - 1_obj.txt/1_code.txt/1_ans.txt
		The new quest your adding should be
		 - 2_obj.txt/2_code.txt/2_ans.txt

Objective ({name}_obj.txt) - Should be a maximum of 1 line.

Code ({name}_code.txt) - Where you want there to be a input field type in "{option}"

Answers ({name}_ans.txt) - The answers should align with the order in which the input fields are presented.
Meaning the first input field corresponds to the first answer from this file.
Every next answer should be on a new line.
